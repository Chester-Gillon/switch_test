The following shows the config which was used for the TP-Link T1700G-28TQ as an injection switch to test
24 100M ports on a switch under test.

On the injection switch:
- 1G Ports 1 to 24 connected to the switch under test, where these ports auto-negotiate to 100M to match
  the maximum supported speed on the switch under test.
- 10G port 26 connected to the PC running the switch_test program.
  Uses a SFP+ DAC cable and a QSFP to SFP+ adapter to connect to one QSFP port on a dual-port Mellanox
  ConnectX-2 VPI card in the PC.

The important settings compared to the defaults are:
a. Under L2 Features -> 802.1Q VLAN -> VLAN config add VLANs 1001 .. 1024 in which:
   - A tagged member of port 26.
   - A untagged member of one port 1 .. 24 (corresponding to VLANs 1001 .. 1024)
b. Under L2 Features -> 802.1Q VLAN -> Port config for each port 1 .. 24 set it's PVID to 1001 .. 1024
   corresponding to the VLAN for the port. This is so that frames received from the switch under test get
   tagged with a VLAN to indicate which port they were received on.

Also changed the System-VLAN ID 1 to remove untagged member ports 1 to 24. After doing just a) above got a
broadcast storm and initially changed the System-VLAN ID as initially thought that would avoid the broadcast
storm. However, without b) any frames received from the switch under test weren't tagged which could have lead
to the broadcast storm allowing frames to circulate.

In the factory defaults of the T1700G-28TQ Spanning Tree was already globablly disabled.
